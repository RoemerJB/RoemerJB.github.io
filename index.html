        <h3>Why HBO suits me</h3>
          <p>I think HBO suits me because you work a lot independently, which I like. <br> 
            That and it's more practical than uni, so you actually get practical knowledge instead of only theory.</p>
        <h3>Why this programme?</h3>
          <p>I've always liked working with computers, and after my first programme getting in depth <br> 
            with webdesign I knew I wanted to do more. I chose this specific programme because of it's broad possibilities.</p>
